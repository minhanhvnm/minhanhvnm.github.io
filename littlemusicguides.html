			<p>My inspiration for this project was someone I once knew who insisted that classical music was the most boring thing in the world. If not boring, then classical music is typically described as “calming”, “classy”, “productivity music”&mdash;something I found, as a musician, to be incredibly frustrating, totally obscuring the variety of color and feeling expressed in classical music.</p>
			<p>I can understand where those feelings come from, but I was curious as to whether there was a way to help non-musicians understand the color and drama in classical music as vividly as musicians do.</p>

			<h3>How To Listen To Music</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="image-set row">

		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<p>I first turned to some of the literature on listening to classical music, written by famous <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/02/16/listen-to-this" alt="Alex Ross, Listen to This" target="blank">music critics</a> and <a href="http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/schools/wheatonhs/departments/aphonors/Copland_HowWeListen.pdf" alt="Aaron Copland, How We Listen" target="blank">composers.</a>
			<p>Two insights&mdash;
				<ul>
					<li>There’s no “accurate” portrayal of classical music aside from the music itself.<em>The interpretation of music is fluid and ephemeral.</em> It varies from person to person, from listen to listen.</li>
					<li><em>There are a multitude of ways to appreciate music</em>, beyond just emotional. Appreciating music can be as simple as appreciating the sensation of the notes themselves.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>	
			<p>In my ideas in the exploratory phase of this project, I focused on communicating these two ideas using actual pieces of music as examples.</p>

			<h3>Preliminary ideas</h3>

			<p>I found that in my initial ideation, the ideas that I came up with were pretty abstract. People I talked to didn't find the concept compelling, as the ideas didn't address a really basic experience that non-musicians have&mdash;classical music is simply difficult to listen to.</p>
			<p>After initial exploration of subject material, I started thinking more about places where someone might encounter music (and my publication). Eventually, I came to focus on a concert hall&mdash;a traditionally stuffy environment, with dense concert programs and without an entry point into the music.</p>
			<p>As I started to tailor my idea generation towards a more well-defined context, I found a real-time listening guide to be the most promising entry point into music.

			<h3>An Entry Point</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="image-set row">
			<img src="images/littlemusicguides/littlemusicguides-8.jpg" class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">

			<p>My first prototype: a picture book with a simplistic story that I made up (left). The story is accompanied by brief descriptions of the music and snippets of the score tucked between the pages via a French fold technique (right), something that a listener could use as something to actively listen for. Timestamps on the corners of the mainspreads mark the beginning and end of little segment of the piece that a single spread represents, so listeners have something concrete to reference. I used preschool-friendly language for the story, to turn the &ldquo;classy&rdquo; connotations of classical music on their head.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<h3>Listener Testing, Round 1</h3>
			<p>Parts that were successful—the picture book format was fun, light-hearted, accessible, and the story was easy to follow.</p>
			<p>After testing my rough paper prototype on several users, I realized that the French fold technique was not very easy to use—it was difficult to turn back and forth between the musical description and the story, and users tended to spend more time on the musical description anyway, because the information is more dense.</p>
			<p>I also realized that the score didn’t add anything. It was pretty-looking, but users often became distracted trying to follow it, not understanding that only a snippet of the score was included.</p>
			<p>Finally, with having to jump back and forth between the page, the description, and the timestamps, listeners would often miss the cue to go to the next page. There was too much multitasking involved.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12">
			<h3>Listener Testing, Round 2</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="image-set row">
			<img src="images/littlemusicguides/littlemusicguides-10.jpg" class="col-xs-12">
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<p>I got rid of the French fold technique, putting it all on one page—the story, the timestamp, the description. I also added “turn the page” cues, so that the listener would not have to constant refer back to the timestamps to know when to turn the page.</p>
			<p>Listeners who I tested both prototypes on described the newer one as more immersive.</p>
			<p>However, listeners often still missed the audio cue, unsure if what they were listening to was exactly what I described. With the timestamps so far away from the description, it was difficult to estimate the amount of time a user was supposed to spend on each spread. Additionally, the page numbers were hardly referenced at all.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<h3>The End Result</h3>
			<p>This is what the piece looked like in the end.</p>
			<p>I created experiences for three different pieces from three different eras of music—“Spring” by Vivaldi, “Danse Macabre” by Saint-Saens, and “Passepied” by Debussy. I also added a third volume; a transcription of a lecture by Leonard Bernstein. The lecture was geared towards children and described about how indescribable music can be in a brilliantly easy to understand way. Finally, I made a <a href="http://littlemusicguides.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> to provide a collection of the relevant audio, crafted especially for this listening experience.</p>

			<p>I used a cream-colored, thicker paper, emulating paper you might find in a music book, and tied the whole thing together with twine (the twine/hole combination reminded me of stringed instruments). I used glossy paper for the outside paper plaques to contrast with the soft finish of the printed covers.</p>

			<h3>Ending Notes</h3>
			<p>I really enjoyed the opportunity to look at a side of music education that isn’t normally addressed—music education for non-musicians. It was really exciting to see the people who tested out my prototypes listen really closely to the music, and to see their reactions as they followed along with the story.</p>
			<p>I learned the importance of questioning the where and when designing an experience or product&mdash;doing so changed the content I was communicating dramatically. I also learned to appreciate the tactile elements of publication design: the quality of the paper used, the quality of the printing, the tactile between the different materials.</p>
			<p>I do think that there are weaknesses in my design. Not all pieces can be described in this format: there are many pieces out there without easily-defined sections, and pieces with well-defined sections don’t always graft well onto a light-hearted story in a way that makes sense. Lastly, pieces can vary wildly from performer to performer&mdash;a description that fits one performance of a piece might not fit with another.</p>
			<p>If I had gone back and adjusted parts of my process, I would’ve liked to talk to more student musicians like myself&mdash;this maybe would’ve given me more insights as to how non-critics interpret music.</p>
			<p>I also have questioned from the very beginning the idea of tying music with a story. As described by Bernstein&mdash;the last volume of my set&mdash;music isn’t really “about” anything aside from... music. It’s never about a story. Little Music Guides seems a little self defeating in this way. Something I've asked myself a lot, even after I finished the project, is this: Why underscore the fact that music isn’t about a story, when the entire set is based around music as stories?</p>
			<p>Still, I think back to when I was six or seven, playing really simple pieces on the piano—I used to dream up silly little stories about the pieces I was playing. Although it’s not perfect, it’s an entry point into listening and appreciating classical music.</p>
