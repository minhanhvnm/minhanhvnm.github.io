			<p>Three lighthearted real-time listening guides to three pieces of classical music, accompanied by a transcription of a famous 1950s TV broadcast on classical music for young children.</p>
			<p>Classical music is usually described as &ldquo;calming&rdquo; or &ldquo;classy&rdquo;&mdash;totally different from the energy and color and emotion that a musician might hear in a classical piece. I was curious as to whether there was a way to help non-musicians understand the color and drama in classical music as vividly as musicians do.</p>

			<p>The volumes are for three different pieces&mdash;“Spring” by Vivaldi, “Danse Macabre” by Saint-Saens, and “Passepied” by Debussy. I also added a fourth volume; a transcription of a Young People's Concert by Leonard Bernstein. Finally, I made a <a href="http://littlemusicguides.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> to provide a collection of the relevant audio, crafted especially for this listening experience.</p>

			<h3>Initial Ideas</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="image-set row">
			<img src="images/littlemusicguides/littlemusicguides-6.jpg" class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
			<img src="images/littlemusicguides/littlemusicguides-7.jpg" class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<p>My first ideas focused on the idea that there are multiple ways to appreciate a piece of music, and that different people can approach a piece and take away totally different interpretations, based on some writing on listening to classical music written by <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/02/16/listen-to-this" alt="Alex Ross, Listen to This" target="blank">music critics</a> and <a href="http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/schools/wheatonhs/departments/aphonors/Copland_HowWeListen.pdf" alt="Aaron Copland, How We Listen" target="blank">composers.</a>
			<p>I found that in my initial ideation, the ideas that I came up with were pretty abstract. People I talked to didn't find the concept compelling, as the ideas didn't address a really basic experience that non-musicians have&mdash;classical music is simply difficult to listen to.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<h3>Prototype, Round 1</h3>
			<p>I started thinking more about the listening experience, and how I might make the experience more accessible.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="image-set captioned col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 no-gutters">
				<img src="images/littlemusicguides/littlemusicguides-8.jpg" class="captioned">
                <p class="caption">My first prototype was a picture book with a whimsical, preschool-friendly story I made up that listeners could flip through as they listened to the piece.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 no-gutters">
				<img src="images/littlemusicguides/littlemusicguides-9.jpg" class="captioned">
                <p class="caption">The story is accompanied by timestamps, and brief descriptions and snippets of the music tucked between the pages.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<p>People who tested my paper prototype found the picture book format fun, light-hearted, and accessible.</p>
			<p>But, I also realized that the French fold technique was too cumbersome to be usable&mdash;users often got lost between all the different types of information. Some of that information, like the score, didn&rsquo;t contribute to the experience at all.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12">
			<h3>Prototype, Round 2</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="image-set row">
			<img src="images/littlemusicguides/littlemusicguides-10.jpg" class="col-xs-12">
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<p>I got rid of the French fold technique, putting it all on one page—the story, the timestamp, the description. I also added “turn the page” cues, so that the listener would not have to constant refer back to the timestamps to know when to turn the page.</p>
			<p>Listeners who I tested both prototypes on described the newer one as more immersive.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph col-xs-12 col-md-7">
			<h3>Final Product</h3>
			<p>I used a cream-colored, thicker paper, emulating paper you might find in a music book, and tied the whole thing together with twine (the twine/hole combination reminded me of stringed instruments). I used glossy paper for the outside paper plaques to contrast with the soft finish of the printed covers.</p>
